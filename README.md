# Masterthesis_LipolysisAdipogenesis
This repository includes the code for an RNAseq analysis on floated iWAs of iDAKO mice and 3D cultured iWAs. This analysis was done as part of the master thesis project 'Importance of Lipolysis for Adipogenesis in vitro and in vivo'.
The code includes an analyiss of each model system individually as well as a combined dataframe of both model systems for a comparative analysis. 
The first sections include the data analysis (1:350) and the rest of the code represents the graphs and plots made to illustrate the analysis.
